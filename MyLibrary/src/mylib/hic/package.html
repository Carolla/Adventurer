<body bgcolor="white">

General resuable library of utility functions for the human interface (HIC). 

This library contains not only classes that can be reused between packages, but also
classes that were defined and can be reused between programs. <br> 
<p>
NOTE: There will be much commonality between Carolla's two flagship program, 
the <i>Dungeon Authoring Tool</i> and <i>Adventurer</i>, the Player Module,  
but these classes will NOT be kept in the library. The commonality between these two
programs results mostly from duplication, and are not necessarily resusable for most programs.
