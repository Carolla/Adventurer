<code>myLib</code> Contains the application independent classes, 
such as the <code>MsgCtrl</code> class for audit and error messages during JUnit tests,
a Help engine, reusable GUI widgets, and other helper classes.  
<P>
NOTE: There is much commonality between Carolla's two flagship programs, 
<i>Quest Master</i>, the authoring tool, and <i>Adventurer</i>, the Player program.  
This development library contains general purpose reusable classes, but not ones that 
are specific to <i>Chronos</i>. Chronos-specific classes will NOT be kept in the library 
if they are not necessarily resusable for most programs.
See the Chronos library.
