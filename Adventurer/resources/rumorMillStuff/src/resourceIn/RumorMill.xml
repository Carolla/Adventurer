	<intro>
		You step inside the door beneath the old weather-beaten sign: The Rumor Mill,
        and find yourself in the interior of a darkened and smokey room.
        As your eyes adjust to the dimness,  you see serving women preparing food. 
        The burly Innkeeper is filling mugs from behind a solid oak bar along the north wall.
    </intro>
	<room name="Main Room">
		The common room of this Inn is heated by the large fireplace 
	    near the center of the room. Rough wooden tables are scattered 
	    about the main floor. A couple of booths can be seen along the 
	    east wall. The aroma of roasted meats and ale fills the air, 
	    and the smokey smell of the fireplace thinly covers it all.

				The Innkeeper is a burly man with a thick beard. His apron is stained with food and 
				wine. The faint smell of fireplace smoke drifts to you as he gets closer.
		    	"See anything you like?", he asks in a semi-toothless smile.
