Provides the internal engine, application rules, and algorithms involved with playing the game.

Problem Doman (Component) is implemented in this package. 
The PDC resides between the HIC and the DMC, the design-centered interface to the user
world or the system (JVM). The PDC attempts to keep a strong separation-of-concerns
between the four components of the application. 
See the general description in the Overview.
<p>
The commands of the system are in its own package.  
See the <code>pdc.command<code> package.
