Provides all front-end activities for user interaction, main window, command input, help
window, splash screen, and start-up activities. 

Human Interface (Component) is implemented in this package. 
<code>Dgn</code>contains the <code>main</code> method and all the global
data (such as file directories) and static methods (like output message methods for
errors and debugging). 
(Some static data in the HIC package is made available to the DMC.)
<p>
The static <code>main</code> method checks command line arguments and starts 
the splash window and the main window. The splash window has its own thread to run 
background tasks like <code>init()</code> and <code>load()</code>. 
<p>
The <code>MainFrame</code> class collects user commands and pushes them into the
<code>CommandParser</code>, which waits until the PDC Scheduler polls for them.
The Swing thread of the <code>MainFrame</code> windowing system interleaves with the 
thread of the <code>Scheduler</code> to retrieve and execute the commands created.
