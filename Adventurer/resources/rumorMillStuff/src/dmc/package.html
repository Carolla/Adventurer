Provides all SAX Parsing back-end activities for XML and XSD file input, parsing, and
validation. 

Data Management (Component) is implemented in this package. 
<code>SAXStream</code> reads in the XML data file and validates it against the XSD
Schema file. The SAX Parser that is created requires an author-written error handler
(<code>MyErrorHandler</code>) to handle any parsing or validating errors that occur;
and a content handler (<code>DungeonContentHandler</code>) to move the data into
the appropriate objects.
<p>
<code>DgnBuild</code> creates the SAX Parser, reads the data files, connect the callback
objects, and inits the Inn and other PDC objects.
