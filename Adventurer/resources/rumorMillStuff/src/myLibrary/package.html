A small collection of utility classes; not all are used for Rumor Mill. 
 
<ul>
	<li><code>MetaDie</code> is a universal random generator that can also take dice
	strings as instructions. For example, 3d6 means to roll three six-sided die and add the
	results together. This result will provide a Gaussian (normal or bell) curve instead of
	a linear result if a random number from 3 to 18 were requested. </li>
	<li><code>SwingWorkerTask</code> is a Swing library functon adapted from <i>Core
	Java</I> by Cay Horstmann and Gary Cornell. It is not used in Rumor Mill. </li>
</ul>
