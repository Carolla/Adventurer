The Rumor Mill is a game that asks the user to question various friendly and unfriendly
patrons in an Inn using a classic adventure-game style command dialog.

<h2>Application Description</h2>
The Rumor Mill application is a breadboard-style prototype to allow the author to experiment
with various Java, JavaDoc, and design concepts. It is built rigorously to demonstrate strict 
object-theory implementation.
<p>
The architecture of the Rumor Mill application is segmented into four components: 
<ul>
	<li>Data Management Component (DMC) provides all back-end activities for SAX validation
	parsing. </li>
	<li>Human Management Component (HIC) provides all front-end activities for user 
	interaction.</li>
	<li> Problem Domain Component (PDC) provides the algorithms and work engine to
	execute the application logic. It contains the domain classes that are strongly decoupled
	from the design-centered logic of the DMC and HIC. 
	<li> System Interface Component (SIC) although not used here yet, connects to external
	systems, such as other servers. It is likely that an SIC will be built in the future to interface
	with the <i>FileMaker Pro</i> database system.  
</ul>
Each component talks to each other through connection classes. For example, the command
window pushes user command strings to the <code>CommandParser</code>,
and the <code>Scheduler></code> object polls it to retrieve those resulting Commands.
