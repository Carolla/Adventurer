CIV (Component Interface Validator). <br>
This package contains all classes that are responsible for validating and filtering inputs and 
outputs from and to the HIC classes. The CIV serves as a gateway between 
the HIC (GUI) and the PDC to enforce best data, minimize coupling, and enable automated JUnit testing
of as much of the logic as possible. 
The CIV enables automated JUnit testing by providing a socket to bypass the GUI code, which JUnit 
does not test well. It also is primary in allowing GUI changes to be made (or even replaced) with a 
minimum of effort.
<P>
<i>How to Use CIV Objects</i>.  
Although there is only one CIV component, objects within a particular CIV tend to handle either
output data to the GUI, or input data from the GUI. For covenience, these objects-within-the-CIV
component are referred to as "output Civs" or "inputs Civs".
Input Civs take data from input-oriented GUI widgets, validates it, and converts it to the internal
format before passing the data to the PDC.
Errors are returned immediately by the Civ to the HIC object for displaying in error dialogs.
<P>
Output Civs work symmetrically in reverse of how input Civs work.
Output Civs prepare internally-formatted data into a GUI-viewable format for the output GUI widgets. 
According to the coding standard, no HIC objects may import PDC or DMC objects; 
HIC classes must always send or receive data through a CIV object. 
<P>
Every PDC object that has data to be displayed should know how to display itself,
and thus should implement a {@code display} method, which creates the output Civ, passing the data
to the CIV constructor, which creates the GUI widget. 
HIC widgets can only display String data, so the data from the output Civ to the 
widget can be prepared in several ways. 
<BL>
<LI> If there are only a few parameters, the String data can be passed to the 
widget in its constructor. </LI>
<LI> If there are more than three or four parameters, the {@code String} data can be put into an 
{@code EnumMap}, and passed to the widget's constructor. 
In this case, the order in which the data is put into the {@code EnumMap}
is irrelevant, because the enum key of the map is used for retrieval.</LI>
