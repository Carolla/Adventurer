<i>Adventurer</i>, the playing module of the two-program <bi>Chronos<bi> game set, allows 
player Characters (Heroes) to be created, saved, and explore the dungeon. 
The Tavern, General Store, and professional Guilds support the Hero when he or she is in town. 
<i>Adventurer</i> allows the following capabilities:
<ul>
<li> <i>Biljur'Baz.</i> Generate (and register) a new Character, selecting from a series of Races,  
occupations, and unique abilities. All new Characters start as young Peasants, but can be trained at
the proper Guild. Characters can be saved and retrieved for use in the dungeon, tavern, general 
store, and Guilds. Multiple Characters can be teamed up to go into the dungeon. </li>
<li> <i>General Store.</i> Buy and sell supplies to equip your Hero better.</li>
<li> <i>Tavern.</i> Visit the Tavern to get information from various local non-player characters that 
come and go. Talk with them, buy them drinks or food, or bribe them, but don't tick them off or you
will be ousted into the street by Bork the Innkeeper for annoying his customers. </li>
<li> <i>Guilds.</i> Join one of the four Guilds for training, special supplies, and promotions. Guilds 
provide specific items not available from the General Store, assign dungeon quests, and offer 
promotions for increased abilities for your Hero. Guilds are available for fighters (Arena), magic-
users (Arcaneum,), clerics (Monastery), and rogues (Thieves' Den).</li>
<li> <i>Dungeon.</i> Adventure into many user-defined dungeons made. 
Solve puzzles, fight monsters, find treasure, and gain experience points. 
Explore as a single Hero or control a team of up to four Characters. 
Achieve your Quest to gain for special rewards. </li> 
</ul>
