DMC (Data Management Component): The collection of code classes that is responsible 
for interfacing to all storage media, such as databases, files system, and CD-ROMs. 
The DMC typically contains readers and writer classes for file system I/O, XML files, and
database language queries. 
DMC is one of the major components of a good three-tiered software architecture.
All DMC objects talk with core PDC or SIC classes; no direct communication with the HIC
is permitted. 
<p>
NOTE: There will be much commonality between Carolla's two flagship programs, 
<i>DungeonWizard</i>, the authoring tool, and <i>Adventurer</i>, the Player Module.  
General purpose reusable classes are kept in a development library, but not one that is
specific to <i>Chronos</i>. Chronos-specific classes will NOT be kept in the library, and 
are not necessarily resusable for most programs.
