HIC (Human Interface Component): The collection of code classes that is responsible for
all interfacing to human users. The HIC includes all Graphical User Interface (GUI) artifacts, 
such as menus, dropdown boxes, and dialog windows. The HIC is one of the major 
components of a good three-tiered software architecture. It communicates only with 
objects in the CIV package, and is independent of the other packages. 
<P>
 The input data, or output data, presented by the GUI widgets, are validated and 
filtered by objects outside the HIC. They are contained within the CIV package, and are 
one-to-one with the widgets. The CIV classes allow JUnit to execute the application for
automated testing by by-passing the GUI.
<P>
Some packages are somewhat application independent, such as the Help System,
and although is a part of the HIC, it is contained in a general purpose library elsewhere.
<P>
NOTE: There will be much commonality between Carolla's two flagship programs, 
<i>Quest Master</i>, the authoring tool, and <i>Adventurer</i>, the Player program.  
General purpose reusable classes are kept in the development library <i>myLib</i>, and 
Chronos-specific classes will be kept in the <i>Chronos</i> library.
